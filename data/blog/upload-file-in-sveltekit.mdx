sveltekit is trending nowadays and I believe it totally deserves it. I tried it for one of my side projects and enjoyed it.

sveltekit is a fullstack meta-framework for sveltejs that can handle almost everything we need for developing a web application. one of these features is file uploading and storing it to file system.
for uploading images (or other types of files) in sveltekit, we have 2 options. form actions, and API routes.

### _template_

in `+page.svelte` we can create a form with `multipart/form-data` as its enctype. this form submits to an action handler (that we are to implement in a moment):

```html
<form action="?/avatar" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="avatar" placeholder="avatar" />
  <button type="submit">upload</button>
</form>
```

### _Action Handler_

as the sveltekit documentation says:

> actions allow you to POST data to the server using the `<form>` element.

basically, they are functions that run on the server and are specifically designed for accepting form actions. you can read more about them in [sveltekit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/form-actions)

then we have to create an action handler in `+page.server.ts`. this file can be used for providing page initial data (by exporting a function named `load`) and defining form action handlers.
note that as specified in `<form />` tag, the action name should be `avatar`.

```ts
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import path from 'path'
import { redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit'
import type { PageLoad, Actions } from './$types'

export const actions: Actions = {
  avatar: async ({ request, route, url }) => {
    try {
      const data = Object.fromEntries(await request.formData())
      const filePath = path.join(
        process.cwd(),
        'static',
        'avatars',
        `${crypto.randomUUID()}.${(data.avatar as Blob).type.split('/')[1]}`
      )
      await fs.writeFile(filePath, Buffer.from(await (data.avatar as Blob).arrayBuffer()))

      // TODO: store the file path in database for further references.
      throw redirect(303, url.pathname)
    } catch (err) {
      throw fail(500, { err: err })
    }
  },
}
```

that's it! now the uploaded file will be stored in the static folder and it's accessible like other static assets.

also, I used [crypto module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) for naming files in the file system instead of the original file name, for having the same naming format for all files and removing long file names.

note that this code is not completed logic. the path of the uploaded file should be stored in a persisted storage or database for further usage. also, errors should be handled properly.

## _API routes_

the same functionality can be applied as an API route as well. forms should be submitted using javascript in this way. also if you have multiple clients besides your client-side sveltekit app (like a react-native mobile app) this approach is the one should choose.

we can define API route endpoints in `+server.ts`. for specifying handlers for different HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.) we can declare a function with the name of the HTTP verb. here we want a handler for

```ts
import path from 'path'
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import { fail, redirect } from '@sveltejs/kit';
import type { RequestHandler } from './$types';

export const POST = (async ({ request, url }) => {
    try {
        const data = Object.fromEntries(await request.formData())
        const filePath = path.join(
            process.cwd(),
            "static",
            "avatars",
            `${crypto.randomUUID()}.${((data.avatar as Blob).type.split("/")[1])}`
        );
        await fs.writeFile(filePath, Buffer.from(await (data.avatar as Blob).arrayBuffer()))
            // TODO: store the file path in database for further references.
        return new Response(String({path: filePath}))
    } catch (err) {
        throw fail(500, { err: err })
    }
}) satisfies RequestHandler;
```

Note that in API routes the response body should be generated with `Response` object (which is global to typescript) so it's a little different from form actions.

you can read more about the API routes in [sveltekit routing documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#server).

Although this method works fine for small apps, storing assets and serving them through static path is not considered a best practice. it's not about sveltekit limitations, using an object storage service like Amazon S3 or MinIO is preferred for larger applications.

hope you find this post useful!
